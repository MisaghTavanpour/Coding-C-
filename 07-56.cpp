Classes sometimes need members that are associated with the class, rather than with individual objects of the class type.
a static data member can have incomplete type.In particular, a static data member can have the same type as the class type of which it is a member. A nonstatic data member is restricted to being declared as a pointer or a reference to an object of its class. Another difference between static and ordinary members is that we can use a static member as a default argument.
