list: queue implementations or when we have insertaion or deletion from middle of a container
vector: stack implementation
deque: when we have lots of insertion/deletion from both begining and end of a container
map: when the key to a value needs to be other types beside an int
set: when we just want to keep track of if something has happened or not (or any other two state tasks)
