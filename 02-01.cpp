/*
    short vs. int vs. long vs. long long
    Depend on the compiler, potentially their size is different.
    Language gurantees:  short <= int <= long <= long long

    signed vs. unsigned
    signed types represent both negative and positive values, whereas unsigned types only represnt values equal or greater than 0.

    float vs. double
    Typically, floats are represented in one word (32 bits), doubles in two words (64 bits).
